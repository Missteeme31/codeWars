//Your task is to sum the differences between consecutive pairs in the array in descending order.

//Example
//[2, 1, 10]  -->  9
//In descending order: [10, 2, 1]

//Sum: (10 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 8 + 1 = 9

//If the array is empty or the array has only one element the result should be 0 (Nothing in Haskell, None in Rust).

//MY SOLUTION
function sumOfDifferences(arr) {
  //if arr.length is greater than 1, simply subtract the smallest
  //num of the array from the largest num of the array else return 0
  
return arr.length > 1 ? Math.max(...arr) - Math.min(...arr) : 0
  
}
