//You will be given an array that contains two strings. Your job is to create a function that will take those two strings and transpose them, so that the strings go from top to bottom instead of left to right.

//e.g. transposeTwoStrings(['Hello','World']);

//should return

//H W  
//e o  
//l r  
//l l  
//o d
//A few things to note:

//There should be one space in between the two characters
//You don't have to modify the case (i.e. no need to change to upper or lower)
//If one string is longer than the other, there should be a space where the character would be

//MY SOLUTION 

function transposeTwoStrings (array) {
	//set empty array to push new arr
  let newArr = []
  //set length of longest arr
  let length = Math.max(array[0].length, array[1].length)
   
  //loop through length of array to fill empty array
  for(let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
  //fill with index of first array or empty space and index of second 
  //array or empty space
  let strings = (array[0][i] || " ") + " " +(array[1][i] || " ")
  newArr.push(strings)
  }
  return newArr.join('\n')
}
